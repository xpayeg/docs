        "errors": []
    },
    "data": {
        "STAGING": [
            {
                "community_id": "JBPYOjm",
                "community_name": "Test Community 1"
            }
        ],
        "PRODUCTION": [
            {
                "community_id": "x3XdR31",
                "community_name": "test"

            {
                "community_id": "JBPYOjm",
                "community_name": "Test Community 1"
            }
        ]
    },
    "count": null,
    "next": null,
    "previous": null
